This folder contains e2e tests for ModusCreate Budget app. The detailed testcases and Testplan have been added under the root folder E2E. 
The tests have been written using Javascript webdriverio. The preference of webdriverio over nightmare is its capability to run test over multiple browsers. Nightmare however uses Electron as its executing browser.
Chai.assert has been widely used for assertions.

Also Standalone webdriver with selenium standalone server has been used with mocha as test framework and test runner.
 WDIO Testrunner has been avaoided so as to leverage the utility of using promises and manipulating data using them . 

Tools : Mac OS
